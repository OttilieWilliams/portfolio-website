      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm diving into the world of tech as a Trainee on the BT furtHER Digital Intensive Programme (November 2018 - February 2019). Welcome to my portfolio website!</p>


    <h2>What I have learnt so far</h2>

    <p>I've learned some HTML, CSS, Javascript, UX & UI, and Python. I've also spent time on Github and practiced pair programming. There is so much more to learn and I love spending my spare time delving into tech books, getting past coding
      challenges, and attending coding events - my favourite so far was CodeBar held at Google HQ!</p>


    <h2>My projects</h2>

    <h3>Rock Paper Scissors Game</h3>
    <p>This was my favourite project so far. We used HTML and CSS to create the look and Javascript to engineer the game behind the scenes. I decided I wanted to make it an immersive  world for the players.</p>

    <h3>Mobile Data Plan</h3>
    <p>We did this project in pairs, I did mine with Ellen and we created the EO brand! We used the UX and UI we learnt on the course when we planned the site using Mockflow. We then used Javascript for the calculators, which increased in complexity for each data plan.</p>

    <h3>Women in Tech Biographies</h3>
    <p>We started this at the beginning of module 1, and then added to it as we progressed. We were given the text and tasked with creating pages for three famous women in tech. As we progressed further in the course and learnt about Bootstrap, we used this on the site too.</p>
