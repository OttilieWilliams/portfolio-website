  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>I'm exploring the world of tech as a Trainee on the BT furtHER Digital Intensive Programme (November 2018 - February 2019). Welcome to my portfolio website.</p>

  <h2>How I got into Tech</h2>

  <p>I first became curious when my friend Ella (<a href="https://www.cyberwomen.co.uk">cyberwomen.co.uk</a>) told me about her job as a User Researcher. She was so passionate I wanted to know what all the fuss was about! I taught myself the
    basics of HTML and Ruby on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">codecademy.com</a>, attended coding workshops
    at Bletchley Park, and researched courses, internships and other paths into the industry. I was really excited to be offered a place on the BT furtHER programme, and I'm now two months in.</p>

  <h2>What I have learnt so far</h2>

  <p>I've learned some HTML, CSS, Javascript, UX & UI, and Python. I've also spent time on Github and practiced pair programming. There is so much more to learn and I love spending my spare time delving into tech books, getting past coding
    challenges, and attending coding events - my favourite so far was CodeBar held at Google HQ!</p>
